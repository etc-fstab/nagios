Intro
-----
There is the DAQ temperature device in a server room, 
Here is the plugin [check_temp_daq.sh] to query the DAQ and get the temperature.

Nagios
------
The service cfg for this check is something like:
define service{
  # may diff for you
  use                    generic,pnp  
  service_description    room_temperature
  host_name              your-fqdn
  check_command          check_temp_module_daq!85!95
 }


Graph

The pnp4nagios is used for graphing and here is the relevant template, 
most likely located in /usr/share/pnp4nagios/templates and called check_temp_module_daq.php
